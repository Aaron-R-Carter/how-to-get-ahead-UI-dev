Step 1.//

Extract objects from goals.

- highlight the nouns
- Look for tangible objects, ignore fluffy concepts.
- Be wary of nounds that represent collections of objects (eg catalog)
- Sometimes objects must be inferred based on verbs in a goal.
- Consider different states that an object might find itself in.

Step 2

Define the core content of Objects

- You want to think about core content and metadata
- Core content is unique to an instance of the object (eg games titles)
- metadata can be shared betweeen objects (eg number of players)
- Metadata helps you find like things and core content helps you choose one.

Step 3.

Nest objects for cross-linking

- Do one object at a time
- Start considering relationships between objects
- Talk about how these relationships can support achieving goals. 

Step 4

Forced Ranking

- Put things in order from most important to least important
- For metadata focus on ways to sort and filter
- Think in terms of must-havs, should-haves, and could-haves.
- Don't get concerned with what your interface will look like.
